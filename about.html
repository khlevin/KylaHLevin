        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my webpage! My name is Kyla.<br>
            I am from a small town about an hour away from Philadelphia. I left in 2019 to study Chemical
            Engineering at Tufts University's School of Engineering. There, I took introductory computer science
            courses where I first fell in love with CS, and eventually added it as a double major. During this time,
            I researched computational biology under Lenore Cowen as a Laidlaw Scholar during the summer of my
            sophomore year and published my first paper. Later, I joined my advisor, Jeffrey Foster, in researching
            a formalism for a new, path-sensitive programming language. <br>
            In 2023, I graduated from Tufts and enrolled in my current M.S./Ph.D. Computer Science program at
            University of Massachusetts Amherst under my advisor, Emery Berger. Here, my research primarily focuses
            on systems and programming languages, specifically ChatDBG and how to utilize LLMs as debugging
            tools.<br>
            When I have it, I enjoy ballroom dancing and rock climbing in my free time with my partner.
